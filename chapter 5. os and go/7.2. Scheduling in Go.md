# Scheduling in Go

## Part 1 - OS Scheduler

### Introduction

The design and behavior of the Go scheduler allows your multithreaded Go programs to be more efficient and performant.

### OS scheduler

Operating system schedulers are complex pieces of software. You program is just a series of machine instructions that need to be executed one after the other sequentially. To make that happen, the os uses the concept of Thread. It's the job of the Thread to account for and sequentially execute the set of instruction it's assigned. Execution continues until there are no more instructions for the Thread to execute.

The OS scheduler is responsible for making sure cores are not idle if there are Threads that can be executing. It must also create the illusion that all the Threads that can executing at the same time.
